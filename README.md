# Go Crash Course
This course aims to give you not only a basic understanding of Go,
but to help you develop your first Go application, test it, expose it
via HTTP, pack it into a container and automate the build-test-pack process.

## Setup your environment
First things first :)
- Go to [the Go downloads page] and follow the instructions to set it up based on your system
- Download [Visual Studio Code]

Now that this is out of the way, let's get coding so you can familiarize yourself with
the environment and the language.

This course was envisioned to be kind of interactive.
You can go through it by changing your current working directory to one of the modules
and running `go run main.go`.
Feel free to change the code and play around as you go.
